# Catalogue

## Introduction
Based on the Common Criteria, a sample of common vulnerabilities and project-specific use cases, a catalogue containing concepts and queries is provided. One can use and extend these concepts and queries in a specific evaluation.

## Classes

### "Properties"

This section contains general properties of objects in an IT-system, regardless of its usage. Also terms used to tag high level requirements, like Asset_Confidentiality to tag an asset that shall remain confidential.

### "Cryptography"

This section contains concepts and queries concerned with the correct use and modelling of cryptographic aspects of the TOE.

### "Traversal"

This part of the catalogue contains concepts and queries concerning the correct exchange of data and information on a TOEs boundary.
It supports both local and remote ports, and both encrypted and plain import and export.
It is the evaluators responsibility to correctly tag the code, and provide the correct logic to adapt the queries to the TOE at hand.
